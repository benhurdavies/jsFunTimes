# README

This is a series of exercises gently modified from [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/languages/javascript/exercises). Feel free to suggest new ones!

### JS Fun Times

1. Fork, clone, and yarn / npm install
1. Create a branch to work on a specific test suite, like `leap`
1. Run the tests using `yarn test` (or `npm test`)
    * Run a specific test suite by specifying the test path `yarn test spec/leap.spec.js`
    * `x` before a `describe` or `it` block will skip the test. Delete that `x` when you are ready to implement the new functionality.
    * Some requirements in other test suites are commented out to allow all test to run. Be sure and uncomment to work on that suite.
1. Follow the errors to implement a solution
1. When finished or at end of day, push up your solution or partial solution and submit a PR

### Contribute

1. Create a branch fresh with master
1. Add your new stuff
1. Submit a PR
1. Keep PR fresh with master until merged or closed
